Contributions welcome!

**Before spending lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!**

Please search [issues](https://github.com/dutchenkoOleg/sort-css-media-queries/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/dutchenkoOleg/sort-css-media-queries/pulls) before adding something new to avoid duplicating
efforts and conversations.

Also, you should read the [Change log](./CHANGELOG.md) and the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions
are welcome:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included docs.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and improve the quality of the docs.
- **Formatting**: help keep docs easy to read with consistent formatting.

## Project Governance

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit.

### Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
2. **Non-master branches** should be used for ongoing work.
3. **Significant modifications** like API changes should be subject to a **pull request**
   to solicit feedback from other contributors.
4. **Pull requests** are *encouraged* for all contributions to solicit feedback, but left to
   the discretion of the contributor.
